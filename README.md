# Handouts
Storage for instructional mathematical material written by me.

## Current catalog of handouts
**Math**
- *Geometry Review* - Covers a couple of important geometry concepts
that appear throughout all levels of math contests.
- **WIP** *Inequalities* - Notes from Stuy junior math team on
the basic theory of inequalties,
primarily focusing on AM-GM, Cauchy-Schwarz,
and the rearrangement inequalities.
- *Inversion* - Notes from Stuy junior math team on inversion,
a transformation that can be thought of a reflection over a circle.
- **WIP** *Power of a Point* - This one comes in two parts;
the first part focuses on the standard power of a point theorem, radical axis,
and the so-called forgotten coaxiality lemma, while the second focuses on
linearity of power of a point.

**Tech Tutorials**
- **WIP** *GeoGebra 101* - A guide on using the popular
geometry diagram creation software GeoGebra.
